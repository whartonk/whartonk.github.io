	<h1> Dogs :) </h1>
		<p>Dogs are the best thing in the world. Fight me if I'm wrong
		Because I'm right. Dogs are the best, purest creatures in the
		world.  Cats are great too but I'm allergic to cats, so I'm totally biased.
									       </p>
	<h1> My dogs :0</h1
		<p> My dogs are the best dogs ever. Actually, only one of them is good.
		Her name is pudding, and she's a pitbull doberman mix. She's shy around
		other people, but she's nice around us. My other dog, Cagney (named after
		the police officer TV show, cagney and lacey). She bit my dad and brother.
		She bit my dad on the nose, and my brother on the lip. My brother had to
		get six stiches. She's a boston terrier, and she's tiny. Pudding, on the
		other hand, is so nice and sweet. She's also a big dog, so she takes up 
		a all of the time.)His name is Jake. He's super sweet, but he's like 200 pounds. 
		He's practically a great dane. He loves swimming, and he looks big and scary,
		but he wouldn't hurt a fly. We call him friendly Jake.

	<h1> Pudding</h1>
		<p>Pudding was a rescue from the SPCA. She was really shy for a
		years after we got her, andthen we got her to be a little bit
		more social over time. She now is very social, and she is actually 
		friendly to everyone. This is a video of her when she was younger,
		and she was on the news.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75uwfanPJhE"> Click Here.</a>
		Her name was Subie before we adopted her. Her and her family were called the car puppies. There was Subie, Miata, and Civic.

	<h1 > Cagney</h1>
		<p> Cagney is a purebred boston terrier. She came from a police officer, who
		who couldn't take care of her, and thats why her name is Cagney. It's from a
		show called Cagney and Lacey, about two female police officers.
		Cagney is really mean. Not the police officer one, my dog. She is very 
		agressve, and very over protective. We can't have her out while friends
		are over because she will attack. <a href="https://www.nylabone.com/-/media/Images/Nylabone-NA/US/Dog101/Breeds-A-Z/Boston-Terrier-jpg.jpg"> Click Here.</a>
		She's (normally) really sweet towards my family, though. Well mostly. She bit my dad on the nose,
		and my brother on the lip. He had to get six stiches. I'm the only one in my family who she hasn't bitten.
		She's also really small. She's about 13 pounds, and she's really small.
		She is the meanest small dog ever.

	<h1> Jake</h1>
		<p"> Jake is my uncle's dog. We found him in the streets.He's honestly the sweetest dog in the world.He loves to 
		swim and run, and he is HUGE. Like I mean 195lbs, pure muscle, pitbull.
		If anyone didn't know him, they would be terrified of him.			
		But, jake doesn't have the capability to hurt anyone. When Cagney attacked him once, he literally just
		sulked in the corner. He wags his tail so much that if it hits you,
		it hurts. He loves food and he loves to lick people.
		He has an orange collar and vest, and they both say 'Friendly jake', because thats just how jake is.
		He's a miracle, considering we found him on the streets, and he was an ex-fighting dog.
